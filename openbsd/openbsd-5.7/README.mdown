# Packer templates for OpenBSD 5.7

Templates creating Vagrant boxes for OpenBSD 5.7 (amd64 and i386).

## Prerequisites

* [Packer] v0.7.2
* [Vagrant] v1.7.2
* [VirtualBox]
	* Version 4.3.26 for Windows
	* Version 4.2.8 for Mac OS X (which allows [HAXM] to work in parallel)

[Packer]: https://www.packer.io/ "Packer by HashiCorp"
[Vagrant]: https://www.vagrantup.com/ "Vagrant"
[VirtualBox]: https://www.virtualbox.org/ "Oracle VM VirtualBox"
[HAXM]: https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager

## Provisioned software tools

* sshd
* rsync
* sharity-light
* `vagrant` user and its insecure public key
* ... and their dependencies

## How to create a box

From the terminal, invoke the following command:

	packer build openbsd-5.7-amd64.json

and you will find a vagrant box file named `OpenBSD-5.7-amd64.box`
in the same directory after the command has succeeded.

Then you can add the box named `OpenBSD-5.7-amd64` to your box list
by the following command:

	vagrant add OpenBSD-5.7-amd64.box --name OpenBSD-5.7-amd64

## Default settings

These default settings are done by the file `Vagrantfile.OpenBSD` which will be included in the box.
Users can override this setting by users' own `Vagrantfile`s.

### Synced Folder

Due to Vagrant limitation of OpenBSD support, Synced Folder of this box is disabled by default.

### SSH Shell

Because Bash is not the standard shell for OpenBSD, default shell for SSH connection of this box
is set to "`/bin/ksh`".
